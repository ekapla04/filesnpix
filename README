We used office hours frequently. We also used google for syntax and other 
errors. We ran into some major memory issues and Ben London gets a special 
shoutout for helping us figure those out.  

Implementation:

To our knowledge, our programs work to the full extent. However, we did not 
test simlines with large files. The other programs (readaline.c and 
brightness.c) were thoroughly tested and we didnâ€™t find any issues. We 
spent approximately 30 hours completing this assignment with the bulk of 
it on coding. 

Hours spent on this project: Around 30.
