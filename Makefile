# 	         Makefile for COMP 40 Homework 1
#
#     Author: Noah Mendelsohn (adapted from Norman Ramsey's compile script)
#
#  Maintenance targets:
#
#
#    all         - (default target) make sure everything's compiled
#    clean       - clean out all compiled object and executable files
#    brightness  - compile just the brightness program
#    simlines    - compile just the similar lines program
#
#

# Executables to built using "make all"

EXECUTABLES = brightness simlines

#
#  The following is a compromise. You MUST list all your .h files here.
#  If any .h file changes, all .c files will be recompiled. To do better,
#  we could make an explicit target for each .o, naming only the .h
#  files it really uses.
#
# Add your own .h files to the right side of the assingment below.

INCLUDES = 

# Do all C compies with gcc (at home you could try clang)

# (which is .), Comp 40 .h files, and CII interfaces

# Set debugging information and update linking path
# to include course binaries and CII implementations

# Libraries needed for any of the programs that will be linked
# Both programs need cii40 (Hanson binaries) and *may* need -lm (math)
# Only brightness requires the binary for pnmrdr.

#    'make all' will build all executables
